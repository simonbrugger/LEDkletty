# LEDkletty
In this repo you can find the CircuitPython code for an LED version of ergobag's kletties. [Kletties](https://www.ergobag.com/en/kletties) are kind of sticky patches to individualize the look of your ergobag backpack. The LEDkletty makes your ergoback light up.

# The idea
The LEDkletty is compatible with the standard ergobag Kletties areas. You can stick the LEDkletty on a backpack and swtich it on. The NeoPixel Ring will play random led animations triggered by motions. You don't need to switch off the LEDkletty. If no motion is detected the leds will not light up.  

# The components
For this project I used (so far): 
* adafruit [GEMMA M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501) board
* adafruit [NeoPixel 24 Ring RGBW](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2863)
* shock sensor SW-18020P to detect motion
